Question 1:
Hi there,
I'd like to build an autocomplete search like on https://glose.com/bookstore. How can I build that kind of search using my PHP backend?
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Cheers,
Jason

Question 2:
Hey
We currently use swiftype. I'd like to learn what the main differences with respect to that.
Thanks. Hugo.

Question 3:
Hello.
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to
hear, but I really hate the new design. Clearing and deleting indexes
are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while
iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Also it would be great to access exporting Analytics data to a CSV or to access them via an API.
Regards,
Matt

Question 4:
Hi, we are looking at Algolia as an option to replace our CloudSearch. After looking at your pricing and documentation, I have a few questions about pricing and search

1. We have three domains right now that contain different data. Would we be able to use a single Algolia account with different endpoints for each of those domains? For example, if we have fewer than 1M documents across the three domains, can we use a single Growth account?

2. We have a staging environment that also has three domains. The size of our data in the staging environment is fairly close to production to test performance in a realistic way. Queries per second is obviously much, much lower. What is the pricing for a non-production environment?

3. Does filtering on facets restrict the documents returned or the facets returned?

4. If the answer to 3 is documents, can we filter on facets using ranges? Or alternatively, can we provide arrays for faceted attributes where we can return the document if any of the values in the array match the filter (similar to querying against array fields in MongoDB)? As an example scenario, we have categories containing sub-categories which contain products. When in the parent category, we need to be able to search products in all of its sub-categories. In the sub-categories, we need to be able to search products in only that sub-category.
Let me know if anything is unclear. It looks like a great product so I'm excited to hear back!
